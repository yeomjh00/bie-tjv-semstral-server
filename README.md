# Query
- Basic CRUD queries for each entity
- Return number of music list owned by specific user. (For restriction) 

# Complex Business Operation Logic
Assumption: Behavior of Presentation Layer(user) is omitted. (Since I assumed all behaviors in this layer are just pressing the button as an action, update the window as a respondance)

## User Status Degradation
When user's membership is expired(or, decide to degrade him/her status), after he/she push the button,

1. user client get some information about music lists
2. If it violates the restriction, it will be rejected.
3. If not, user client send request to server

**Trial member can have 5 music lists, and 30 musics in each list at a time.**

## Creating Music List, Adding Music to list.
Similarly, based on the restriction described above, user client get some information about music lists, and send request to server.
